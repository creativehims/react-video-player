# Video Player

A video player application developed to make a case for how stateful components pass data (video source string) and logic 
(function to update video source) as props to stateless (presentational) components. 

## Note:

This project is a functional component based implementation of the "Video Player" project challenge in the "Create a Front-End app with React" Skill Path at Codeacademy.
